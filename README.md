# 🧠 B7Web Studies

This repository contains all my projects and exercises developed during the **B7Web Full Stack course**.  
Although most projects start from the course content, I usually **add my own improvements and modifications** to go beyond the lessons — focusing on better structure, readability, and extra features.
